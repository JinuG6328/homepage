<!-- ::: {#hero-heading} -->

I am a researcher at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where I apply computational methods to solve scientific problems.


## Education
PhD May 2018 - Dec 2024, Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia institute of technology, Atlanta, US <br>
MS Aug 2016 - May 2018, Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia institute of technology, Atlanta, US <br>
BS Mar 2009 - Aug 2016, Energy resources Engineering & Computational Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea


## Professional Experience
**Research Intern** | Schlumberger-Doll Research, Cambridge, MA | May 2022 - Aug 2022
- Engineered an innovative automated framework integrating machine learning predictions with uncertainty quantification and actionable model recommendations
- Developed a novel weighted out-of-distribution (WOOD) indicator by combining Gaussian parameterization with feature importance analysis using PCA and SHAP methodologies

**Research Intern** | Schlumberger-Doll Research, Cambridge, MA (Remote) | May 2021 - Aug 2021
- Pioneered a cement evaluation model using transformer architecture, leveraging synthetic data for pre-training and real-world data for fine-tuning to maintain physical accuracy
- Achieved significant performance improvements, reducing regression error mean from 0.13 to 0.07 and standard deviation from 0.32 to 0.25


## Personal Interests
Outside of research, I enjoy staying active through swimming and kickboxing. 
I'm also passionate about exploring different cuisines and discovering new restaurants.

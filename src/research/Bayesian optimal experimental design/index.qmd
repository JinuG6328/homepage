In research settings where experiments are expensive, time-consuming, or potentially hazardous, 
it's crucial to optimize experimental design to maximize information gain. 
This research advances Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) methodology to address these challenges.

##  Approaches

BOED has employed several key methodologies:

1. **Gaussian Approximation Method**  
   This approach leverages Gaussian approximations of posterior distributions to evaluate uncertainty reduction through posterior covariance matrices.

2. **KL Divergence Method**  
   This method involves calculating the expected Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between posterior and prior distributions to quantify information gain.

While these approaches are theoretically sound, they often involve significant computational overhead, limiting their practical application.

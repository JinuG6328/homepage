Neural operators have emerged as a powerful tool for learning mappings between function spaces, with direct applications to PDEs. 
These operators provide an elegant solution to reduce the computational burden of infinite/high-dimensional PDE solvers. 
Through their application in Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED), we've developed two approaches:

## DINO (Derivative-informed Neural Operator)

DINO incorporates derivative information. We've trained a model that achieves superior accuracy in both parameter-to-observable maps and their corresponding Jacobians. 
Key features include:
- Efficient surrogate modeling for time-independent PDEs
- Dramatically reduced computational costs while maintaining high accuracy

Our comprehensive analysis and theoretical foundations are detailed in our paper:  
**[Accurate, scalable, and efficient Bayesian optimal experimental design with derivative-informed neural operators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14810)**

## LANO (Latent Attention Neural Operator)

Building on the success of DINO, we developed LANO to address the challenges of sequential Bayesian optimal experimental design. This architecture introduces several innovative features:
- Advanced latent attention mechanism for handling complex temporal dependencies
- Efficient optimization methods for sequential experiments
- Specialized components for capturing biological system dynamics

The theoretical framework and experimental results are extensively documented in our paper:  
**[Sequential infinite-dimensional Bayesian optimal experimental design with derivative-informed latent attention neural operator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09141)**

Through these innovations in neural operator architectures, we've significantly advanced the field of BOED. 
Both DINO and LANO demonstrate substantial improvements in computational efficiency and model accuracy, making them valuable tools for real-world applications.
